# Data-Visualisation-Project

This project demonstrats my knowledge and abilities to use Data Visualisation tools such as PowerBI to derive business insights and facilitate business decision making. 

Project aims: Built a visualisation dashboard using Microsoft Power BI to derive insights from the sales data of a coffee chain.

Below highlights several dashboards that has been built: 
- The *sales overview dashboard* is a visual representation of sales data and it provides an overview of the coffee chainâ€™s key performance indicators

- The *sales comparison dashboard* is designed to facilitate the sales comparison between branches of Coffee Chain XYZ

- The *year-over-year analysis dashboard* is designed to determine the changes, analyze growth and recognize trends on an annual basis

- The *profit analysis by product dashboard* is designed to analyse the profit gained for each of the products

- The *sales by product dashboard* is designed to investigate how well a product is progressing in sales and how well the marketing investment towards that certain product in a certain area is translated into sales
